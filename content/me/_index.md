Hi!! I'm the creator [Protyasha Roy](https://protyasharoy.netlify.app).

I'm currently a student preparing for university entrance exams in [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh). I learned to code but forgot most of the things. So, I don't even claim to be a programmer or a developer. But hey, I'm into a lot of things other than programming.

Here are some of my interests out of many other interests: [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics#:~:text=Physics%20is%20the%20scientific%20study,physics%20is%20called%20a%20physicist.), [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy), [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess)

Besides these I:
- am a fan of [one piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece).
- rewatched [one piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece) twice.
- compose [songs](https://on.soundcloud.com/RoBG1FKdRYwiBiA28) sometimes on my guitar.
- consider [stalker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalker_(1979_film)) to be my favourite movie of all time.
- am trying to be a [minimalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism).
- think we might be [simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis).
- am a [metalhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalhead). Even though I'm into all sorts of music.
- think [Tool is science and science is Tool](https://youtu.be/EShM-EOAlj4). 
- get called a [nerd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd) sometimes.
- hate [cultural conformity](https://helpfulprofessor.com/conformity-examples/).
- am a [postmodernist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism)(kinda).
- am a [INTP](https://www.verywellmind.com/intp-introverted-intuitive-thinking-perceiving-2795989)
