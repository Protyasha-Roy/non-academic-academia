This site is intended to be a personal blog-site but for learning and teaching purposes. I will be writing about various topics that I am interested in. But the twist is that even though the approach would be non-academic, the content would be academic. That means I will try my best to write academic content in a way that is easy to understand and can be easily followed. With the right resources, and methods, even academic topics can be fun to learn.

It's going to be a step by step guide. I will try to cover as much as possible to have an overall good idea about the topic. It's going to pretty in depth, but you know, there is no end to knowledge. Still, I will be keep updating the content as I learn new things or there is a change in information in an already existing topic.
