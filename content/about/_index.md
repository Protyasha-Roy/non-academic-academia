This site is my personal **blog-site** dedicated to **learning** and **teaching**. I’ll write about various topics that interest me, with a unique approach: while the tone will be **non-academic**, the content will remain **academic**. My goal is to present complex ideas in a way that is **easy to understand** and engaging. With the right **resources** and **methods**, even challenging topics can become **fun to learn**.

The site will follow a **step-by-step guide** format, aiming to provide a solid understanding of each topic. I’ll strive to cover topics in **depth**, keeping the content updated as I **learn new things** or as **information** evolves.

I also **code** occasionally—often when inspired or simply curious. However, this site is not a casual **boredom project**. It’s a platform I deeply value for its potential to promote **learning** and **teaching** while helping me **organize my thoughts**.

Above all, I want this site to be as **resourceful** and **informative** as possible—without being overly **complex** or overwhelming. I’ll curate the best and often **underrated resources**, making this a go-to place for **learning** and discovery.

Topics will follow a **zettelkasten** structure, with each topic serving as a **knowledge base** for related topics. This structure allows for easy **navigation** and **organization**, making it easy to find what you need.  

For any query, suggestion or comment, you can [email](mailto:protyasharoy369@gmail.com) me.
