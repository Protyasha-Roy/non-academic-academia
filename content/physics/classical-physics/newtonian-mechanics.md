Newtonian mechanics, also known as classical mechanics, forms the cornerstone of classical physics. It provides a mathematical framework for understanding the motion of objects under the influence of forces, from falling apples to orbiting planets.

## Fundamental Laws

### First Law: Law of Inertia
An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. This principle challenges the ancient belief that objects naturally come to rest and introduces the concept of inertia.

### Second Law: Force and Acceleration
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically:

F = ma

Where:
- F is the net force
- m is the mass
- a is the acceleration

### Third Law: Action and Reaction
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This law explains the nature of forces as interactions between objects.

## Applications in Classical Physics

Newtonian mechanics successfully explains:

1. Planetary motion and orbits
2. Projectile motion
3. Simple harmonic motion
4. Fluid dynamics
5. Rotational motion

These principles continue to be essential in engineering and everyday applications, from designing buildings to understanding sports mechanics.
