Modern physics encompasses the revolutionary theories and discoveries that transformed our understanding of the universe in the 20th century and beyond. This field challenges our classical intuitions and reveals the fascinating nature of reality at both quantum and cosmic scales.

## Key Areas

1. Quantum Mechanics
2. Special and General Relativity
3. Nuclear Physics
4. Particle Physics
5. Quantum Field Theory

Each of these areas represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of nature, introducing concepts that often seem counterintuitive but are supported by extensive experimental evidence.
