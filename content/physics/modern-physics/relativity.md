Einstein's theory of relativity fundamentally changed our understanding of space, time, and gravity. It consists of two interrelated theories: special relativity (1905) and general relativity (1915).

## Special Relativity

The theory of special relativity is based on two fundamental postulates:

1. The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another.
2. The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion.

### Key Concepts

- Time Dilation: Time moves slower for objects moving at high speeds
- Length Contraction: Objects appear shorter in the direction of motion
- Mass-Energy Equivalence: E = mcÂ²
- Relativistic Mass: Mass increases with velocity

## General Relativity

General relativity extends special relativity to include gravity, describing it as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.

### Predictions and Confirmations

1. Gravitational Time Dilation
2. Gravitational Lensing
3. Black Holes
4. Gravitational Waves
5. Expanding Universe

These predictions have been confirmed through various experiments and observations, most recently with the detection of gravitational waves by LIGO.
