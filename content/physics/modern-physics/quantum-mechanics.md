Quantum mechanics is perhaps the most successful yet mysterious theory in physics. It describes the behavior of matter and energy at the molecular, atomic, nuclear, and even smaller microscopic levels.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Wave-Particle Duality
Matter and light exhibit both wave and particle properties, a concept first proposed by Louis de Broglie. This duality is exemplified in the famous double-slit experiment, where individual particles create an interference pattern characteristic of waves.

### Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
This principle states that we cannot simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with arbitrary precision. Mathematically:

ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2

Where:
- Δx is the uncertainty in position
- Δp is the uncertainty in momentum
- ħ is the reduced Planck constant

### Quantum Superposition
A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured, famously illustrated by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment.
