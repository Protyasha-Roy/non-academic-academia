Nuclear physics studies the components, structure, reactions, and interactions of atomic nuclei. This field has led to numerous applications, from energy production to medical treatments.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Nuclear Structure
The atomic nucleus consists of protons and neutrons (collectively called nucleons) held together by the strong nuclear force. The number of protons determines the element, while different numbers of neutrons create isotopes.

### Nuclear Forces
- Strong Nuclear Force: Holds nucleons together
- Weak Nuclear Force: Responsible for radioactive decay
- Electromagnetic Force: Repulsion between protons
- Gravity: Negligible at nuclear scale

## Nuclear Reactions

### Nuclear Fission
The splitting of heavy nuclei into lighter ones, releasing energy:
- Used in nuclear power plants
- Chain reactions
- Nuclear weapons

### Nuclear Fusion
The combining of light nuclei to form heavier ones:
- Powers the Sun and stars
- Potential future energy source
- Hydrogen bombs

## Applications

1. Nuclear Power Generation
2. Medical Imaging (PET, SPECT)
3. Radiation Therapy
4. Nuclear Dating Methods
5. Industrial Applications
