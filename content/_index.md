description: "Non-academic academia is a personal blog-site but for learning and teaching purposes. I will be writing about various topics that I am interested in. From the ground level to the most advanced level.I want to share everything here that I once suffered to learn or to find a solution for. It's the place where I share everything I learn. In a way, that I wished I had someone to learn from."
