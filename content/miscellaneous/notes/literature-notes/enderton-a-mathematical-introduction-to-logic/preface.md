Book: [A Mathematical Introduction to Logic](/miscellaneous/notes/literature-notes/enderton-a-mathematical-introduction-to-logic/)

## Preface

This book, like the first edition, presents the basic concepts and results of logic; topics are proofs, truth and computability. And it is directed towards the people with some mathematical background and interest. In contrasts to the first edition this second edition has numerous local changes and three global changes-

1. It was attempted to be more accessible for typical undergraduate students.

2. For instructors and independent readers the organization of the book has been made more flexible with footnotes at the beginning of many of the sections.

3. Theoretical computer science has influenced logic a lot in recent years and some of that influence is reflected in this edition. Issues of computability are taken more seriously. Some material on finite models has been incorporated.

It is intended to server as a textbook for introductory math course in logic at junior-senior level. It tries to present the importance concepts and theorems of logic in relation to reader's other mathematical work. Again its intended for people who have not read logic before but has some experience in mathematical reasoning.

One should not begin with chapter zero. Cause it is there to be used as reference when the need arises. Reader can study this section in a flexible way if needed.

There are exercises at the end of nearly all the sections.
