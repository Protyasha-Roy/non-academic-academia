### Key points

#### Overview
This article is about finding sources to support a specific wikipedia articles. Since articles on an encyclopedia have to be neutral and accurate, the sources also have to be independent. But many sources are either not available online or needs special permission to get access to. Even with this obstacle there are ways to get access to these credible sources. Academic papers through open access repositories, news stories from newspapers with a reputation for accuracy, and books which have previews on digital libraries.

#### Types of sources
Even though there are many types of sources, some are appropriate only in certain situations. For specific case, we might need to look for specific types of sources.
- **Scholarly articles**: short papers published in academic journals.
- **Books and monographs**: longer academic or popular works.
- **Textbooks**: Instructional or educational manual for a particular subject.
- **Dictionaries and encyclopedias**: reference works containing a listing of terms and their meanings.
- **Archival**: historic documents.
- **Magazine articles**: short papers in popular or trade publications.
- **Newspaper article or news reports**: writing or multimedia that discusses current events or editorial analysis.
- **Reports and other grey literature**: A broad category that includes most government documents, conference proceedings, and other writings not provided by traditional publishers.
- **Statistics**: data, particularly census data, and analysis.
- **Theses and dissertations**: works created as a requirement for the completion of an advanced postsecondary degree.
- **Websites, blogs and other user-generated sources**: online content from a variety of authors/publishers.
