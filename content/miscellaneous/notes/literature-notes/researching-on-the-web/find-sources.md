This article is about finding sources to support specific wikipedia articles. Since articles on an encyclopedia have to be neutral and accurate, the sources also have to be independent. But many sources are either not available online or need special permission to get access to. Even with this obstacles there are ways to get access to these credible sources. Academic papers through open access repositories, news stories from newspapers with a reputation for accuracy, and books which have previews on digital libraries.

- Internet archive and Google books index millions of books, both academic and popular.
- Unpaywall browser extension finds legal free versions of scholarly articles.
- [OurResearch.org](https://ourresearch.org/) is a non-profit organization that creates tools for better research and free access to scholarly articles. Unpaywall is a product of OurResearch.
- Public or resaerch libraries have both books and research databases.

#### Evaluating sources
- Identifiable biases, qualification and reputation of the author.
- Biases, editorial reputation of the publisher. Or is it a self-published?
- Publication date. Is it outdated?
- Citations based on facts or opinions if it cites its own sources?
- Is the source [primary, secondary or tertiary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources)?
- Are there obvious errors or omissions?
