## Introduction
Here you will find free [eBooks]() and resources for a lot of topics. I have gathered and read these eBooks throughout these years by surfing the internet and getting to know about [online piracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_piracy). Even though many books listed here are pirated, I'll always mention the sources and the original author.

But this isn't a list of random books. I listed the best of the best books out there for each topic.
So that you don't have to be confused about which book to follow. I will give review of each book as well. You can then choose which book to read.
## Sites to get free eBooks
List of few sites I use to get these eBooks for free.
- [Libgen](https://libgen.is/):  My most favorite site for downloading eBooks. Downloadable in a lot of the formats.
- [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/): Library with over 70k free eBooks. It's the oldest and original eBook project on the internet. Great for finding **textbooks**. It's a volunteer project under a public domain. And downloadable in a lot of the formats as well.
