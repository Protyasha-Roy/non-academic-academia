Today is the first day of the year. Planned to study the whole day. But woke up late. Didn't study at all. It's 2:20 PM now while I'm writing this. I have entrance exam in KUET(a Bangladeshi engineering university) on 11th January. Ruined one day already. Let's see if I can make a comeback lol!!

Got into a new error for this site. This page is not being listed.

I downloaded my NID pdf card today. Can't believe I'm already officially an adult of this country. A citizen ready to vote, ready to create bank accounts and shit. Now I don't need to rely on other's accounts for stuff.

After fixing the problem went to meet my girlfriend. Had a lovely afternoon. But couldn't study whole day. Before I went with her I set up a new Hugo site for my personal portfolio site. Made some changes and hosted it after coming back.

Had  chicken wings with her. She had a chicken burger. I shared two chicken wings with her. And coke for both. Total cost was 290 taka. She paid 100, I paid the rest.

She shared that she's under a lot of stress and was feeling awkward and anxious. Tried to help her with some advice.

That's all for today.
