Woke up late again. Started studying at 4 PM or around 5 PM. Thought I will finish studying all of Physics 1st paper. Targeted for 3 chapters in 3 hours. But I only studied for 1:20 hours. Again distracted by the phone. 

Today is a cold day. This new year really came with winter. Still in Dhaka.

Went to sleep early. Around 11 PM. But again scrolling and shit.
