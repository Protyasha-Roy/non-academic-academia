Today is the last day of the year. Nothing special happened. However, I'm still working on this blogsite. The day passed so fast.

Had a little feast at night. I paid 250 for the picnic. We basically had duck meat with pulao([pilaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilaf)). After having the main meal took a glass of soft-drink and a glass of desi [yogurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogurt).

After 12:00 AM, people started firing fireworks all over. Massive sound pollution. Anyway, before going to sleep I thought I'll start the new year with a studious day. So after watching the latest [India's got latent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_E3bLYuQBo) show I went to sleep at around 3 AM and set alarm for 10 AM.

Happy new year!
