Let's set the goal for today.

x: Finish Physics 1st paper.

x: Research on computer and it's parts.

D: How to find credible sources to learn.

x: Journaling and taking notes.

Today I feel positive. Let's see where it goes.

Read a wikipedia article on how to find credible sources. But coudln't finish other activities. Even this finding credible sources goal is not completely complete. I think I need to learn more on how to use the sources right. Still came around some great sources.

Other than this, a  new married uncle joined as a roommate. Man I feel so sick here.
