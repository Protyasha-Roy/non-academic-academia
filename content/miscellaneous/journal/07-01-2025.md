After going through a useless day decided not to attend the exam for KUET entrance and rather create a new schedule to follow and finish the syllabus within 37 days. 
I really hope I don't fuck up this time and study consistently.

So, created a schedule. And started reading the book "A mathematical introduction to logic" by Herbert B. Enderton.
