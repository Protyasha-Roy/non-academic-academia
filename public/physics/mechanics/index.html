  <p>Mechanics explores the principles of motion, forces, and energy. Learn how these concepts form the foundation of physics.</p>
<p>Here you will find two methods for taking notes for single layered and multi-layered topics. Single layered topics are those which are single articles/books/papers. And multi-layered topics include study of multiple books/papers/articles.</p>
<h1 id="kiwi-method">Kiwi method</h1>
<p>Kiwi method is a nested method for taking notes for multi-layered topics. The name &lsquo;Kiwi&rsquo; was chosen because the fruit Kiwi is a multi-layered fruit, and simply I like the name Kiwi(keeuuweeeuueee sounds cute, right?). The method is described below step by step.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say, we want to study &lsquo;Big bang&rsquo; (the most accepted scientific theory for the origin and evolution of the universe). To study this complex topic from the academic and non-academic overall multiple sources keeping track of multiple books/articles/papers become really tough. Here are the steps I follow in order to study complex and multi-layered topics like these.</p>
<h2 id="first-layer">First Layer</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a folder with the topic&rsquo;s title. In this case &lsquo;The Big Bang&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Now create these 5 notes inside &lsquo;Additional&rsquo; folder: <strong>To read</strong>, <strong>Summary and key-points</strong>, <strong>Personal thoughts</strong>, <strong>Further readings</strong>, <strong>Draft</strong>, <strong>Doubtful claims</strong>, <strong>References</strong>.

          <td>Summary and key-points</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Draft</td>
          <td>Put scattered thoughts/points here that you will organize later. You can delete this note after organizing the content.</td>

      <tr>
          <td>Doubtful claims</td>
          <td>Here you write down the doubtful claims found from the sources. This will get shifted to the &lsquo;Further readings&rsquo; note.</td>

          <td>References</td>
          <td>Put all references here for each read.</td>

<h2 id="second-layer">Second Layer</h2>
<ol start="3">
<li>Create folder for each reading(paper/book/article).</li>
<li>Create two more folders named &lsquo;Additional&rsquo; &amp; &lsquo;Chapters&rsquo; or &lsquo;Part-number&rsquo; if there are multiple parts(again create two folders for each part).</li>

<ol start="6">
<li>Inside the &lsquo;Chapters&rsquo; folder create single notes for each chapter and write down the key-points, what you learn and a summary inside each note.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="gluon-method">Gluon method</h1>
<p>Gluon method is a method for taking notes for single layered topics. Single layered topics are those which are single articles/books/papers. This method is named &lsquo;Gluon&rsquo; because gluon is one of the fundamental/elementary particles and as always, I like the name. So, it tries to imply the fundamental layer just as single layered notes(though elementary particles are not easy to understand).</p>
<p>This method is not different from the second layer of the Kiwi method. So, I&rsquo;ll just copy-paste the second layer here.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create folder for the reading(paper/book/article).</li>
<li>Create two more folders named &lsquo;Additional&rsquo; &amp; &lsquo;Chapters&rsquo;/&lsquo;Sub-sections&rsquo; or &lsquo;Part-number&rsquo; if there are multiple parts(again create two folders for each part).</li>
<li>Now create these 7 notes inside &lsquo;Additional&rsquo; folder: <strong>References</strong>, <strong>Unknown terms &amp; words</strong>, <strong>Summary and key-points</strong>, <strong>Personal thoughts</strong>, <strong>Further readings</strong>, <strong>Draft</strong>.</li>

<ol>
<li>Divide each chapter/section into sub-sections. Give headings accordingly.</li>
<li>Write down the unknown terms and words as you read the sub-section. Don&rsquo;t search for the meaning of it unless it&rsquo;s necessary to understand the next lines.</li>
<li>Note down key-points, further readings, and doubtful claims as you read.</li>
<li>After finishing a whole chapter write down a summary and write your personal thoughts.</li>
<li>Write draft if needed for anything that you are not sure of, but want to organize later.</li>
<li>Link references of key-points, doubtful claims and personal thoughts as you read.</li>
